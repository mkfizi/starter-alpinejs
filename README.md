# Starter AlpineJS
Boilerplate for AlpineJS and TailwindCSS projects.

## Usage
This barebone boilerplate serves as starting point when developing web applications or sites. It eliminates the need for base configuration for AlpineJS and Tailwind. By default, this project is utilizing [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for source code bundling but can be switch to any bundling tools.

## Installation
Clone this repository to get started.

Run the following command in project directory to install dependencies.
```bash
npm install
```

Run one of the following commands to execute, build or preview site using Vite server:
```bash
npm run dev

```

> Note that Vite is configured to use `src` as the project root, and will dynamically build all `.html` files located inside the `src` directory.
